Chemically, this corresponds to preparing the target by benzoylation of the preformed chiral 2‑hydroxy‑substituted pyrrolidine (the tertiary amine can be Boc‑protected or free during or after the step). Practically one would synthesize the C2‑substituted pyrrolidine bearing the free secondary alcohol (from e.g. nucleophilic substitution on a 2‑halo pyrrolidine or by asymmetric addition to a suitable precursor), then install the benzoyl group using benzoyl chloride (or PhCOOH with DCC/DMAP) to give the observed benzoate.

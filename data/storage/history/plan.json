A transition-metal-catalyzed [2+2+2] cyclotrimerization of three alkynes (or trimerization of acetylene) is a well‑established forward reaction that forges three new C–C bonds and delivers the aromatic ring in a single operation. This disconnection is chemically reasonable and high‑yielding with appropriate catalysts (Co, Ni, Rh) and is a classic strategy for constructing benzene cores from simple alkynes.'"

Chemically, this corresponds to preparing the target by benzoylation of the preformed chiral 2‑hydroxy‑substituted pyrrolidine (the tertiary amine can be Boc‑protected or free during or after the step). Practically one would synthesize the C2‑substituted pyrrolidine bearing the free secondary alcohol (from e.g. nucleophilic substitution on a 2‑halo pyrrolidine or by asymmetric addition to a suitable precursor), then install the benzoyl group using benzoyl chloride (or PhCOOH with DCC/DMAP) to give the observed benzoate. Boc installation/removal on nitrogen is a separate, straightforward protection/deprotection step.'"
